        <h2>Urea Production</h2>
        <h3>Chemical Formula and Role</h3>
        <p>Urea (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is a nitrogen-rich compound used primarily in fertilizers and as a precursor in industrial applications.</p>

        <h3>Manufacturing Process</h3>
        <p>The production of urea involves several well-coordinated steps to ensure efficiency and maximize yield. The process is described in detail below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A mixture of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is compressed under high pressure (~240 bar) and moderate temperature (~200°C).</li>
                    <li>This mixture reacts to form ammonium carbamate (NH<sub>2</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub>) in an exothermic reaction. The heat generated is utilized for producing steam, improving energy efficiency.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Conversion to Urea:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ammonium carbamate decomposes into urea (NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub>) and water under controlled conditions:</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Reaction:</span> NH<sub>2</sub>COONH<sub>4</sub> → NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
                    <li>This step is equilibrium-based, and efforts are made to optimize the conditions to favor urea formation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Purification:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mixture contains urea along with unreacted ammonia, carbon dioxide, and water. These byproducts are recycled back into the system to minimize waste.</li>
                    <li>Biuret, an undesirable byproduct that can harm plants, is minimized by controlling the process conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Granulation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The purified urea solution is crystallized and granulated into solid particles for easy handling and application as fertilizer.</li>
                    <li>Granulation ensures uniformity in particle size, improving its utility in agricultural applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Applications and Importance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fertilizer:</strong> Urea provides 46% nitrogen, essential for crop growth. <span class="highlight">Example:</span> Used in rice and wheat farming.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Uses:</strong> Raw material for plastics, adhesives, and resins. Also used in diesel exhaust fluid to reduce emissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cement Production</h2>
        <h3>Key Components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Calcium Silicates and Calcium Aluminates provide strength and set the cement.</li>
            <li>Gypsum (5%) controls the setting time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Cement</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC):</strong> General-purpose cement.</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid-Hardening Cement:</strong> Gains strength quickly; ideal for urgent projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-Heat Cement:</strong> Used for mass concrete structures like dams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Manufacturing Process</h3>
        <p>The cement production process involves multiple steps to ensure the desired properties and quality of the final product. These steps are outlined below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Extraction:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raw materials such as limestone, clay, and shale are extracted from quarries located near production plants.</li>
                    <li>These materials are carefully selected for their chemical composition to ensure quality cement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Crushing and Milling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The extracted materials are crushed into smaller particles and ground into a fine powder to facilitate chemical reactions during heating.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Preheating:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The powdered raw meal is preheated to around 900°C using hot gases from the kiln. This step removes moisture and volatile impurities.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Clinkering:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a rotary kiln heated to 1500°C, the raw meal undergoes chemical reactions to form "clinker"—small, hard nodules of calcium silicates.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Reaction:</span> CaCO<sub>3</sub> → CaO + CO<sub>2</sub></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cooling and Grinding:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The clinker is cooled rapidly to preserve its structure and ground into a fine powder with gypsum.</li>
                    <li>Gypsum controls the setting time of the cement.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Applications and Importance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Foundations, roads, and bridges rely on cement for stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Dams, tunnels, and skyscrapers use specialized cement types.</li>
        </ul>
